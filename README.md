Hi, my name is CJ Wheelan. I'm a Sophomore at Dartmouth College planning on majoring in CS (and maybe minoring in Econ).

I am interested in all things coding, but specifically I love using SwiftUI and Firebase for iOS app development.

I am currently learning how to use C++ and OpenCV for computer vision tasks.

I am always looking for cool app ideas, so if you have one feel free to shoot it over!
